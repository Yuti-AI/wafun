This repository stores materials for DQLab Data Mentoring webinar held by **DQLab X Komunitas R Indonesia X R-Ladies Jakarta**. You can participate by simply click `launch binder` badge above. No need to install anything.

While waiting, you can also play with codes under `data-raw` directory. That directory contains raw data, mostly dirty, and codes that were used to clean them. Good luck!
